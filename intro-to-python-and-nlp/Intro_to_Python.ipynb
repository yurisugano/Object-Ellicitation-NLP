        "\n",
        "You can use the user interface to add elements such as **bold text**, links or pictures. All these elements are converted to plain text and you can inspect what they look like in the background in edit mode. For instance, if you activate edit mode, you will see that a text is bold when it is surrounded by two asterisks, as in `**bold text**`.  You will also see that surrounding text in backticks displays it as a code snipet. This is useful for referencing code in code blocks.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Another important concept is a function. Each function performs, well, a function. Most functions you will use have been created and distributed either by Python itself, or through several packages we will use, such as the Natural Language Toolkit (nltk) package.\n",
        "\n",
        "The code below defines a function named `mean()`. To differentiate functions from variables, functions receive parenthesis. The function we define takes two **arguments**, `number1` and `number2`. Note that these are **local variables**, they only exist within the function.\n",
        "\n",
        "The function then creates a new local variable called `sum` which takes the sum of both numbers. Python handles mathematical operations as you would expect. The function creates another local variable called `average`. Lastly, the function returns the value assigned to `average`.\n",
        "\n",
        "We **call** a function by its name, and add any arguments inside parenthesis. The function returns only what `return` dictates. We typically don't see what's going on in the background of functions.\n",

        "1. Convert the entire transcript into a Python object. It will be a string, which is a very large collection of ordered characters.\n",
        "2. Extract each sentence and attribute it to a person. This can be easily done with a **dictionary**, where each person is a key, and their entire speech is the value associated with that key.\n",
        "3. We can use several methods to break down the entire speech of a person into manageable blocks. For instance, we can create a **list** of words by breaking the single string containing all the text into many individual strings.\n",
        "4. We can perform element-wise operator in each of the elements of the new list. For instance, we can go over all the words and check whether they are verbs.\n",
        "\n",
        "The power of programming comes from the fact that each object inside a list or a dictionary can itself be a list or a dictionary. As such, we can create a nearly infinite structure of organized data. So we will have a dictionary where each person has a list of lists: individual words they used, n-grams (groups of n-words), individual sentences, action words, etc."
